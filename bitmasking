To set/turn on the j-th item (0-based indexing) of the set, use the bitwise OR operation S |= (1 << j).

To check if the j-th item of the set is on,
use the bitwise AND operation T = S & (1 << j).

To clear/turn off the j-th item of the set,
use8 the bitwise AND operation S &= ∼(1 << j).

To toggle (flip the status of) the j-th item of the set,
use the bitwise XOR operation S ∧= (1 << j).

To get the value of the least significant bit that is on (first from the right), use T = (S & (-S)).

To turn on all bits in a set of size n,use S = (1 << n) - 1 (be careful with overflows).
